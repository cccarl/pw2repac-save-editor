# Save file editor for Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac

This GUI program will read your save file for the game, allow you to modify it, and save those changes to the file used by the game. Keep in mind that the game will only read this file once when opening, not while the game is open. Windows only.

# How to use

* Make sure you open the game at least once to create the save file directory and save file.
* Open the program with the game closed, it will automatically read the save data from the game's save file.
* Choose between simply watching your save data for a file, or edit it (this simply adds boxes that allow you to edit the file).
* In the File submenu, pick "Save Changes To File" to write the save file to storage, now the game will read this modified save file once it's opened.
